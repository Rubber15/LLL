# Preface
In this document I want to show my semester 3 progress on what I have learned and what I should be able to do to fulfill the minimum requirements this semester. 

# Products
There are several products I made, where I will show what product shows what learning outcome is mastered.
The products i made are:

## Where to binge 
this is my front to back project which is the main project.

## Where to binge structure
this is the first setup and my test on learning how to code with frontend and to put the entire project from front to back in one.

## Orm test
Here i wanted to learn how to make and orm, and implement it into my main project. Seeing as this is part of a learning outcome i felt this was nice to include in the document.

## Front end test
Considering i never worked with javascript, react or even made or frontend i wanted to playfully learn how to learn and manipulate the front end to get what i want.
Here you can trace how i slowly learned how to work with the front end. 

## GroopySwoopy (gp)
This is our groupsproject made with the students from finland(Oamk).

# Learning Outcome 1: Web Application (IP)

*You design and build **user-friendly**, **full-stack** web applications.*

Clarification:

**User friendly**: You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.

**Full-stack**: You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (JavaScript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.

# Learning Outcome 2: Software Quality
*You use software **tooling and methodology** that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.*

Clarification:

**Tooling and methodology**: Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.

# Learning Outcome 4: CI/CD
*You **design and implement** a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.*

Clarification:

**Design and implement**: You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).

## Continuous Integration

## Continuous Deployment

# Learning Outcome 6: Design
*You translate (non-functional) requirements to extend existing (architectural) designs and can validate them using **multiple types of test techniques**.*

## Architecture

## Design Origin

# Learning Outcome 8: Professional (IP)
*You act in a **professional manner** during software development and learning.*

# Learning Outcome 1: Web Application (GP)
*You design and build **user-friendly**, **full-stack** web applications.*

Clarification:

**User friendly**: You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.

**Full-stack**: You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (JavaScript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.

# Learning Outcome 3: Agile Method
*You can implement the software process for your project according to a given agile software development method.*

Clarification:

**Agile** method: You are aware of most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. You are able to implement the process of your software project according to a chosen methodology.

## Scrum
what is scrum?

why scrum?

## Waterfall
what is waterfall?

why not waterfall?


# Learning Outcome 5: Cultural Differences and Ethics
*You **recognize** and **take into account** cultural differences when working with multi-site teams and are aware of ethical aspects in software development.*

Clarification:

**Recognize**:  Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.

**Take into account**: Adapt your communication, working, and behaviour styles to work with other developers from different cultures; 
Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.  

# Learning Outcome 7: Business processes
*You can explain **simple** business processes and **relate** them to the development of your software project.*

Clarification:

**Simple**: predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths.

**Relate**: understanding the relationships between the process and software.

# Learning Outcome 8: Professional (GP)
*You act in a **professional manner** during software development and learning.*

Clarification:

**Professional manner**: You develop software as a team effort according to a prescribed software methodology and following team agreements. You are able to track your work progress and communicate your progress with the team. You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions. You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.

## Team Communication
**what we use:
We have an elaborate discord server in which we put everything we need in.
We have seperate textchannels for all documents, meetings, meetingreports, links, announcements, schedule and even a seperate channel per team.
We also have 4 voice channels divided in a general chat roon, 2 chat rooms, 1 per team and a meeting room.

## Communication with the Stakeholders
For communicating with out stakeholders we invite them through email to join a teams meeting for the sprint delivery.
Idividual questions online also go through teams.
If we need something else and they are at school we ask them directly.

## What are the others doing?

## Ask for feedback

## Technical Decisions

# Research

# Reflection

 ## What will I do different next time?
